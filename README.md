# wlan-extcap-win
Wireshark extcap interface for remote wireless captures in Windows - based on Adrian Granados' original python scripts on the [wlan-extcap project][wlan-extcap]

This is an easy to install plug-in to allow configuration and remote capture of a WLANPi directly from Wireshark (...I know!)
